# Naive Bayes Review Classifier
A Naive Bayes classifier for predicting positive and negative reviews based on the 1000 most frequent words.


### Running the Classifier
This project requires Python 3.7+.
Ensure that the following files are in your working directory:

 - project1.py
 - train.csv
 - test.csv
 - stopwords.txt

The classifier requires one external package to run (namely, to display the formatted results), Matplotlib:

    pip install matplotlib
Once all the above requirements are satisfied, simply run project1.py.
